    Welcome to AI Fitness Trainer! By using our app, you agree to these terms. Please read them carefully (yes, we know... but just do it 💁‍♂️).
  </p>
  <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
    Our app provides fitness recommendations and workout plans using AI. While we try to be as accurate and helpful as your gym bro yelling “ONE MORE REP!”, we are not responsible for any injuries, soreness, or regretful leg days. Please consult your doctor before starting any fitness program.

    Don’t use our app for anything illegal (duh). Also, don’t try to reverse-engineer or hack our app — our AI gets angry and starts doing push-ups.

  <p className="text-muted-foreground">
    By using the app, you agree to our privacy practices, limitations of liability, and the fact that cardio is still terrible no matter what AI says.
